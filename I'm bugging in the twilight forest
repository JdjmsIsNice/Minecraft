Hello there. 
My name is FlareJdjmsLj and i'm bugging in the twilight forest since yesterday. Every time, when i boot up Minecraft, it loads
for more than 45 minutes, then it crashes.
I have an idea to fix my problem, but it's only an idea. My idea is too kill my minecraft-player: FlareJdjmsLj. In this case, i
would loose my best items - but i will play minecraft.

This is my problem, i hope anyone can help me ;)
